# Common-Objects-in-Hemispherical-Images-Dataset
Common Objects in Hemispherical Images (COHI) is a benchmark testing dataset for object detection in hemispherical/fisheye cameras. It contains 1,000 real fisheye images of 39 classes sampled from the MS COCO dataset with 14.2 object instances per image. The images were captured using a hemispherical camera ELP-USB8MP02G-L180 with the 2,448 by 3,264 pixel resolution and manually annotated with standard axis-aligned bounding boxes afterward. The samples of raw and annotated images from the COHI dataset are shown below.

The names of sampled classes and the number of bounding boxes for each class are presented in the next figure.
